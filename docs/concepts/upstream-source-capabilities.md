# AppSec Scout — Concept: Upstream Source Capabilities

`App\Sources\ValueObjects\SourceCapabilities` declares, per Source, whether it can update an
alert's state, update its severity, add a comment alongside a push, or push a standalone comment.
This document gives the full per-operation picture — verified against each Source's real upstream
API, not just the flags — and explains what appsec-scout does when a staged local change turns out
to have nowhere to go. See [docs/concepts/triage.md](triage.md#staging-vs-pushing-a-change) for how
staging and pushing work day-to-day, and
[docs/concepts/sources-trackers-source-control.md](sources-trackers-source-control.md#capability-matrices)
for the `SourceCapabilities`/`TrackerCapabilities` shape.

## Per-source capability matrix

| Source | State push | Severity push | Comment attached to a state/severity push | Standalone comment push |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AzDO Advanced Security** | Yes — `PATCH` on the alert, `state` field | **No** — severity is server-computed and read-only; AzDO's own API explicitly rejects attempts to set it | Only as `dismissedComment`, and only when transitioning to `Dismissed` — no comment field on any other state transition | **No** — no thread/discussion API exists for alerts at all |
| **AppScan on Cloud (ASoC)** | Yes — `PUT Issues/Application/{appId}/Update`, `Status` field | **Ambiguous** — the published swagger schema lists a writable `Severity` field on the same update call, but ASoC's own behavior treats it as unsupported in practice. Needs live-tenant verification before this is ever relied on — don't assume it's settled either way | Yes — `Comment` rides the same `Status` update payload | **No** — the `Comments` endpoint is read-only (`GET` only); there is no create-comment operation |
| **Detectify** | Yes — `POST vulnerabilities/uuid/{uuid}/{statusAction}/` | No — no severity-set endpoint exists anywhere in the API | **No** — the status-change endpoints take no comment/note field at all | **No** |

**Structural fact worth internalizing**: none of the three connected sources expose an API for
posting a comment independent of a status change. This isn't a gap in appsec-scout's
implementation — there is nowhere to send that request. `SourceCapabilities::canPushStandaloneComment`
exists to name this capability formally (for whichever future Source might one day support it) but
is `false` for every Source today, and there is no `Source` contract method to act on it even if a
Source declared it true without also adding one (see below).

## What happens when a staged change has nowhere to go

Local-first means an operator can always stage a state, severity, or comment change locally,
regardless of whether the connected Source can ever receive it — appsec-scout never blocks or
warns against a local edit at the moment it's made. The question of "can this actually push
anywhere" is answered later, when a Sync operator runs a push (`App\Sync\PushEventStatesJob`, via
`Admin -> Pending Sync`), by `App\Sync\PendingSyncResolver`:

- **Pushable** (state change on any Source today; a severity change if some future Source ever
  sets `canUpdateSeverity: true`): attempted via `Source::pushEventState()` as normal — success
  clears the staged field(s) and `is_dirty`; failure retries (up to 3 attempts) with the error
  recorded.
- **Not pushable** (a severity change on every Source today; a standalone comment on every Source,
  always): resolved as **local-only** — a system-authored comment is left on the alert's own
  Comments tab explaining exactly why ("`<Source>` does not support updating alert severity" /
  "does not support receiving a comment independent of a state or severity change"), an `ErrorLog`
  warning is recorded, and `is_dirty` is cleared. The staged value itself (e.g. `pending_severity`)
  is **not** cleared — it stays visible as a durable local annotation, distinguishing "operator's
  own read on this alert" from "what the source last reported."
- **Misconfigured** (a Source declares `canPushStandaloneComment: true` with no actual push
  mechanism — impossible today since no Source declares it, but guarded against regardless): the
  event is left dirty and an `ErrorLog` error is recorded, rather than silently claiming
  resolution for a capability that was declared but never wired up.

This resolution runs both from a live `PushEventStatesJob` run and from the one-off
`events:recompute-pending-sync` Artisan command — a backfill for events that were dirtied under
the pre-fix logic (where a severity-only or comment-only change stayed flagged "pending sync"
forever, since nothing ever evaluated it). The backfill is safe to re-run: once an event resolves,
it's no longer dirty and the query that selects candidates skips it.
